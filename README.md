# SimFeedback-AC-Servo

## SimFeedback AC Servo Version - Virtual Racing Motion Simulator 

SimFeedback is a PC software, that will receive telemetry data from Racing games/simulations like iRacing, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars, ... . This data is used to create motion cues by transforming them into motion commands.

In this Version, motion commands will be send to a mirco controller (Arduino based) that will control closed loop AC Servos.

We will show you how to build the SFX-100 DIY actuators, the Electronics, the Software and get all of this up and running.
